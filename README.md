This repo contains my notes and implementations of Andrej Karpathy's Playlist: Neural Networks: Zero to Hero

# 1. Micrograd

An autograd engine for building neural networks.
Built from scratch, can be used as a standalone library.

It implements gradient descent for a simple neural network.

### Topics covered:
- Gradients
- Backpropagation
- Autograd
- Neural Networks
- Loss Functions
- Optimization

# 2. Makemore
Makemore is character-level language model, which takes one text file as input, where each line is assumed to be one training example, and generates more text like it.

Eg: If we feed it a text file with baby names, it will generate more baby name-like text.

### Currently, these are the choice of models available:
- [ ] Bigram
- [ ] MLP
- [ ] CNN
- [ ] RNN
- [ ] LSTM
- [ ] GRU
- [ ] Transformer
